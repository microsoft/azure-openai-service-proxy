""" This module contains the RateLimit class which is used to rate limit the api calls """

# this class will be used to rate limit the api calls
# the class will use a dictionary to store the number of calls
# made by each user
# the key to the dictionary will be the users token
# the key properties include the number of calls made and the time of the last call
# the rate limit will be calcultated by the number of calls made in the last 10 seconds
# the user token properties will be deleted from the dictionary after 10 seconds of no calls
